# HOSPITAL-MANAGEMENT-AND-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM
Based on patient satisfaction Survey using KNN algorithm to recommend the best rated hospital and most recommended doctor to improve general hospital operations.

# Prerequisites
Advanced C++ (Complete Data Structure is must)\ 
KNN Algorithm\
Basics of Machine Learning Algorithm

**Key Features**
•	Multi user account system\
•	Monitoring the whole hospital system \
•	Management of all type of users’ account \
•	View Hsopital Details\
•	Responsive User Interfaces\
•	Rated hospital lists.\
•	Prescribed hospital \
•	Best available doctors.

**BENEFITS of LOGIN:**
Entering into the system (Registration)
Every single type of user except admin will go through initial phase i.e. registration in order to start with the system.
The registration process will not be exactly same for all type of users. The following are the common requirement fields:\
•	**UserName** – The user will be asked to enter his / her full name. \
•	**Password** – It is the key field which will help the user to have secure account in the system. \
**Login** : This is also the main common feature of the hospital Management	system.\
Every type of user will have to enter his / her unique id as login id and their passwords which keeps them private and safe. 

**Account Details** :The user will first create his account in the database. For that he needs to sign up using a name and a password. After his account detaiks are stored he can log into the database.

**Binary file for storing** : All the account info will be stored in a binary file, even the hospital details are stored in a binary file. The information will be stored in encrypted format so as not to be altered by any third person.

**Variable Declaration** : The snippet contains all details about the hospitals including hospital id, name, location, number and details about its doctors.

**We can also check the hospital details at any time, any doctor detail as well as their fees. We can also get the recommended hospitals and doctors besed on ratings available or location given.**

**KNN Algorithm** : We have to use KNN Algorithm to predict which doctor is the most suitable for the patient. The patient needs to enter his budget and disease as well as location or hospital (i.e. the basics to know about his location and budget) and the most efficient recommendation will be suggested to him.
